# Reference zero fuel weight. This is not the same as operating empty weight
# It's only an estimate of a typical zero fuel weight (i.e. OEW + payload)
# of the aircraft on a typical mission. This is used in place of actual ZFW
# when ZFW is unavailable and the FMC needs to do performance calculations
# which depends on it. In metric tons.
